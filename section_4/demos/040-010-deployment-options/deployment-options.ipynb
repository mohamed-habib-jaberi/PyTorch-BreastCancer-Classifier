    "# ONNX Format\n",
    "In this demo we are going to go through the process of exporting our best model to ONNX format and then using the runtime for inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do this?\n",
    "ONNX is an open standard format that enables model interoperability across different frameworks and platforms, making it easier to deploy models in diverse environments such as cloud, edge, or mobile devices. \n",
    "\n",
    "ONNX Runtime is highly optimized for performance, providing faster inference speeds through techniques like graph optimizations and support for hardware accelerators, including GPUs, CPUs, and specialized inference chips. This combination allows developers to achieve scalability, portability, and performance improvements, while simplifying integration into non-PyTorch ecosystems."
